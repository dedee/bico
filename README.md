WHAT IS BICO
============

You love to do some sports (running, cycling, etc.)?
You are using Google MyTracks to record your GPS tracks with your Android phone?
You own a MetaWatch or Strata?

If yes, BICO could be helpful to you.

Whenever you start recording a track with MyTracks the important statistics (average moving speed, moving time and elevation gain) are displayed right at your wrist.
